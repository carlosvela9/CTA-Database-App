# CTA-Database-App
The goal of this project is to write a console-based Python program that inputs
commands from the user and outputs data from the CTA2 L daily ridership database.
SQL is used to retrieve and compute most of the information, while Python is
used to display the results and if the user chooses, to plot as well.
